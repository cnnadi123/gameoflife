# gameoflife
An older project simulating Conway's Game Of Life. In the process of revising the code.

Starting the GameOfLife file opens a new window which enables you to select a setup, "Random", "Gosper Gun", or "Glider." Each setup represents a new initial configuration.

Upon selecting a configuration, you can either go through the evolution manually using the Step button, or let it run automatically using the Pause/Run button.
